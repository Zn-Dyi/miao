   View source is a feature,not abug. Thanks for yout curiosity and
   interest in participating!

   Herer are the submission guidelines gor the new and improved csszengarden.com:

   - CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
   - go resposive; test youur layout at multiple screen sizes.
   - your browser testing baseline: IE9+, recent Chrome/Firefox/Safari, and iOS/Android
   - Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
   - use classes for styling. Don't usse ids.
   - web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the filess. Hosted
     services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
     most that reqire custom HTML won't TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this
     page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

   And a few tips on building your CSS file:

   -use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
   -use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
   -use multiple background images to apply as many as yoou need to any element
   -use the Kellum Method for imge replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdl
   -don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

        <h3>So What is This About?</h3>
        <p>There is a continuing need to show the powerof <abbr title="cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existinng designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into thes very page. The <abbr title="HyoerText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> Resource Guide</a> for advanced tutorials and tips on working with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.</p>
        <p><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web: we can always psh it further.</p>
